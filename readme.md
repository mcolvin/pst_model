# Pallid Sturgeon Effects Analysis Quantitative Modelling

## Objectives
The objectives of the current model version is to provide a generic working template to demonstrate abilities to simulate population dynamics.

## Description
This repository contains source code for effects analysis of Missouri River hydro operations on Pallid Sturgeon population dynamics.  

## Spatial extent and grain
The current model simulates a hypothetical population of Missouri River Pallid sturgeon  
	
## Temporal resolution
The model simulates population dynamics on an annual time stepover a user specified time horizon..

## Pallid sturgeon life history and stages included in the model
1. Gametes and developing embryos
2. Free larvae
3. Exogenously feeding larvae and age-0 (up to ~365 days post hatch)
4. Juveniles
5. Adults

Pallid Sturgeon Effects Analysis Quantitative Modeling
===============================================

# Objectives

# Description
This repository contains source code for effects analysis of Missouri River hydro operations on Pallid Sturgeon population dynamics.  

# Spatial extent and grain
The model simulates Missouri River Pallid sturgeon populations from the confluence of the Missouri River with the Mississippi River upstream to the Missouri and Yellowstone River reaches in Montana, USA.  The Missouri River is divided into 2 major basin, lower and upper representing natural breaks in the river system and Pallid sturgeon population.  The upper and lower sections are divided into 2 lower and upper sections.  

* Lower Missouri River basin (RKM 0 to RKM ??)
    * Lower basin-Lower Missouri River segment (RKM ?? to RKM ??))
	* Upperbasin-Lower Missouri River segment (RKM ?? to RKM ??))
* Upper Missouri River basin (RKM 0 to RKM ??)
    * Upper basin-Lower Missouri River segment (RKM ?? to RKM ??))
	* Lower basin-Lower Missouri River segment (RKM ?? to RKM ??))
	
# Temporal resolution
The model simulates population dynamics on a daily time step.
